the wrath of the tacos was short-lived.  Although late 17th-century scholars accepted as fact that
the wrath begin in late summer of 1580, recent evidence was shown that the wrath actually began
earlier--sometime in spring of 1578.  This discrepancy has had wide-ranging implications for
the timeline of General Tactine, one of the key players in the wrath.
Long live the calzone!
